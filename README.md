# Mafeah WP Theme

This is a custom theme for the mafeah website/shop based on Jackpine.

Technologies used:

-   Timber, a library that lets you create WordPress templates using the Twig templating engine
-   Tailwind CSS for rapidly building beautiful designs
-   Alpine.js for adding reactivity to your frontend
-   wpack.io, an awesome tool for asset bundling with Webpack and live reloading with Browsersync (designed specifically for WordPress)
-   Composer and Yarn for modern dependency management

Special thanks goes to the creators of Jackpine, Timber, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and wpack.io for their awesome work.
